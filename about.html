                <article class="about-tekst">
                    <p class="G"> Maaike is a young Belgium designer, aspiring to share her stories in the form of clothing and accessories. Fashion is her medium of choice to give form to her ideas. Although she also ventures outside the format of fashion to give
                        rise to her ideas.
                    </p>
</br>
                    <p>She uses prints, pleats, simple symmetrical shapes and classical patterns.
                      Attempting to give her clothing a life of their own, she hopes new stories are created while they are being worn, forming lasting memories in the mind of their owner.

                  </br>
                    <p>And furthermore attaching great significance to the sensation the wearer has while wearing her clothing and the way they can make the wearer feel.
                    She finds her inspiration all around her, but admits to falling in love with the culture of the rising sun, which has greatly influenced her personal work.
